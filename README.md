# Funny suffering with Go + HTMX practice 

This project is the realization of several labs in the Computer Multimedia Systems discipline. Despite some nuances, making it was fun and I learned a lot, especially practicing Go and trying HTMX. I didn't use any third party libraries, the standard library was enough for my tasks, it's very cool in Go.
<br/><br/>
For sure a person who decides to look at the code of this project will ~~go crazy~~ have a lot of questions, now I will briefly answer the main ones below.

## FAQ

### What kind of crimes are going on the frontend?

I successfully used Tailwind, but at some point (the JS package itself) started crashing, and I didn't have access to the internet, as a result a small part of the styles were written directly in pureðŸ¤“ CSS.

### Why are such strange and illogical things implemented?

Initially the task was to make a website (just HTML/CSS/JS), where I needed to post the results of my work on Adobe, Unity + 3DSMax, etc. I decided to implement it through a server on Go and HTMX, it was my first experience with HTMX. 
It is also worth noting that initially the terms of reference changed very often and sometimes required from me silly (only in my opinion) actions.
Nevertheless, the technical assignment was completed on time and in full. If it had been up to me, many things would have been implemented more correctly, but we have what we have.

### The code looks unoptimized and sloppy in some places, why?

I should note that the code itself is clearly not of the highest quality, 
I haven't studied Go on a decent level yet and probably implemented something not very cool, but I am extremely confident that in the future I will be able to do much bigger and better projects on it.
